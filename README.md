# Phylogenetic placement workflow demonstration files

## Introduction

This is a collection of files used to demonstrate the use of a phylogenetic placement-based workflow.


## Running

If you have [installed pplacer](http://matsen.fhcrc.org/pplacer/download.html)
then you should just be able to run pplacer_demo.sh. This script was meant to
be read, and pplacer_demo.html is a marked up version of it. You can see it
[online](http://fhcrc.github.com/microbiome-demo/)
as well.
