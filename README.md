# Phylogenetic placement workflow demonstration files

## Introduction

This is a collection of files used to demonstrate the use of a phylogenetic placement-based workflow.


## Running

If you have [installed pplacer](http://matsen.fhcrc.org/pplacer/download.html)
then you should just be able to run pplacer_demo.sh. This script was meant to
be read, and there is a 
[nicely marked up version](http://fhcrc.github.com/microbiome-demo/)
to look at as well.


## Authors

Noah Hoffman and Erick Matsen.


## Acknowledgements

We would like to thank Martin Morgan, Sujatha Srinivasan and David Fredricks for their work in making this possible.
